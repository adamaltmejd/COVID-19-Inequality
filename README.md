# Code repository for the paper: "Inequality and COVID-19 in Sweden: Relative risks of nine negative life events, along four social gradients, in pandemic vs. pre-pandemic years"

The code is divided into two parts. Files stored in the folder `data_processing` are used to process the register data. These were run on Statistics Sweden's remote desktop system MONA. To reproduce this part of the analysis, one first needs to get access to the raw register data which requires ethical approval. Please contact the corresponding author if you are interested in reproducing this analysis. The output of this processing is stored in the `data` folder. The rest of the repository includes code to generate figures based on this data. To regenerate the figures, first clone the repository, install the required R packages using `renv::restore()` and then build the `targets` pipeline using `targets::tar_make()`.
